# PN Junction Diode I-V Curve Simulator

This project is a Python-based simulation that models the current-voltage (I-V) characteristic of a semiconductor PN junction diode.

## Description

The simulation implements the Shockley Diode Equation to generate the diode's I-V curve. It also includes an analysis of how the device characteristics change with varying temperatures.

### Physics Background

The core of the simulation is the Shockley Diode Equation:
`I = Is * (exp(Vd / (n * Vt)) - 1)`

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
